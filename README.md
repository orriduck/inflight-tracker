InFlight Tracker is a web application designed to display real-time flight information and metrics. The app provides a visual representation of flight data including position, speed, altitude, ETA, and other important metrics for in-flight monitoring. With the usage of inflight-Wifi (Now American Airlines Only but I am planning to add more airlines soon)

## Features
- Real-time flight tracking with map visualization using inflight-wifi
    - Map will be only available if the inflight-Wifi is actually able to reach internet
    - The app dynamically checks OpenStreetMap tile availability to determine if map can be displayed
    - UI adapts based on whether map data is accessible or not
- Flight metrics display (airspeed, altitude, temperature, etc.)
- Progress charts for flight parameters
- Navigation information (origin, destination, flight number)
- Responsive design for various devices
- Exporting the flight data as a GPX file which can be used to be imported in other apps like Fog Of World etc.
- Data persistence: Flight data is stored in localStorage and preserved between sessions
- Dark mode support based on system preference
- Flight-specific data storage to prevent mixing data between different flights

## Tech Stack

## Features

### Data Persistence
The application now stores flight data in localStorage, allowing you to:
- Resume tracking after refreshing the page
- Keep historical flight data between sessions
- Data is stored per flight number to prevent mixing different flights

### Dark Mode
- Automatically detects and applies your system's theme preference
- Seamlessly switches between light and dark modes
- Optimized UI elements for both themes

## Todo
